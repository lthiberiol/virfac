# virfac
Set of python scripts for the virulence factors project

Common dependency of the scripts are:
    1- Matplotlib
    2- NumPy
    3- SciPy
    4- Pandas
    5- BioPython

Some scripts may also require:
    MySQLdb
    Networkx
    Statsmodels

The majority of these scripts were developed to be used in a interactive session (i.e. vim-ipython)
and a great part of input files are hard coded and probably really badly explained (sorry)...

If interested in something contact me!
